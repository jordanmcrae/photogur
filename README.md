##Introduction
The purpose of this project was to familiarize myself with Ruby on Rails and explore the dynamics of MVC's. It also gave me a chance to work with Herokuapp. Since Herokuapp does not utilize SQLite databases, I learned how to change the database to PostgreSQL database.

##User Guide
1. Begin by clicking the "Add an Image" button at the top of the page.
2. Input the required information, including a valid image URL and you will be redirected to the main page. Your photo will be added to the population at the bottom of the feed.
3. Click on an image to view it independently. From here you may edit the details of the photo or delete it entirely.


* ***Note: This app does not yet have individual user parameters, so all images can be accessed, edited and deleted by any user. User login and image management will be added in a later version.
